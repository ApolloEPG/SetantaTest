Dee encourages a friend to say `snail', and goes on a whirlwind word adventure. Meet a giant snail, a tiny snail, a slow snail, a slimy-trail snail and a smart snail. There's a super snail, and Dee and a friend make a sparkly snail. The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way, and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's word.
